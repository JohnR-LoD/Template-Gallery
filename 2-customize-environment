> ## Modify Virtual Environment
> Lab environments may contain either Virtual Machines or Containers. These can be modified either prior to copying the template or after.
> 
> If the provided virtual machines or containers require changes/updates to or addition/removal of software you may perform this now. Once you have completed the updates you require, or if the virtual machines or containers do not need any software modifications, please advance to the **Save Modified Environment** section to perform tasks such as modifying hardware settings (including RAM and CPU) or removing components like entire virtual machines or networks.
> 
> > [!NOTE] If you make changes to the virtual environment while testing the environment and do NOT want to keep them, you can choose to discard them in the next steps.

## Virtual Machine Licensing

### Windows Virtual Machines

Windows licensing will vary from template to template, and even VM to VM within those templates. There are two versions of Windows which will have unique licensing requirements depending on your use.

- Windows Server virtual machines will not be licensed within LOD provided templates. There are two options in licensing Windows Server virtual machines:

    1. License on your own - This would utilize your own Windows Server licensing keys in a method that corresponds to the licensing agreement between your organization and Microsoft.

    1. Use LODS provided licensing - If you would like for LODS to license your Windows Server virtual machine, please submit a [Lab Services ticket](https://lod.one/support). If you have not already discussed the fees that relate to using LODS licensing with your LODS Account Representative, you should reach out to them first to discuss cost implications.
     
        > [!ALERT] This will incur charges for ALL virtual machines in a lab profile (including non-Windows machines) at a rate according to your customer contract.

- Windows 10 virtual machines will be supplied with the **Enterprise** edition of Windows. This will mean virtual machines will never shut themselves down due to too much time running without a license.
    - However, these virtual machines should be licensed by you based on the licensing requirements between your organization and Microsoft.

### Linux Virtual Machines

Distrobutions of Linux provided in your template will utilize open source licensing and therefore are ready to go on launch!

1. From the lab menu in the in upper right of the navigation pane, select **Save Changes**
1. Select whether you would like to save any changes as an update to the current lab or create a new one.
    
    > [!ALERT] If you have not yet utilized the "Create New" option, you must select it. After creating a new lab in your own organization you may choose to make additional updates here by updating the current lab.

## Determine Additional Required Cloud Components
Determining the required cloud components and designing a template to deploy them will be different depending upon your cloud provider. Please select the cloud provider in your lab and follow the steps below to generate a resource template.

> [!ALERT] The previous step [**Save Modified Environment**](#save-modified-environment) above and the access control policy changed may be required before you can successfully perform these steps.
