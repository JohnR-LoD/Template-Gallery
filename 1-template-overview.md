### Linux Desktop on Hyper-V

This template includes a Linux Desktop envrionment hosted on Hyper-V. Due to limitations between Hyper-V and Linux guests, you may see limited functionality when compared to Windows on Hyper-V such as no Dynamic Screen Resizing and Type Text not working. If Hyper-V is not a requirement, it is recommended to use the vSphere version of this template for a more complete experience with Linux desktop environments.

## **Template Feedback/Requests**

The templates provided in the public gallery are designed to meet common lab scenarios to help you get your labs up and running as quickly as possible with minimal configuration. 

To provide a better lab developer experience, we need your feedback to expand and improve our library. Is there software we should add to virtual machines in the gallery? Should some settings be different by default? Should additional services be added to the virtual machines? Is there a common scenario that you feel should be addressed by the gallery? 

Please let us know your feedback by contacting us at <a href="mailto:Templates@learnondemandsystems.com?subject=Feedback Source: Lab @lab.LabProfile.Id">Templates@learnondemandsystems.com</a> with a description of the template design you'd like to see and as many details as possible. We would love to hear from you!
